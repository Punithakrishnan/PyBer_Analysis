# PyBer_Analysis
Using Matplotlib, Python and Pandas to analyze and visualize Ride-sharing data with Jupyter NoteBooks.

---
### Project Goal
mproving access to ride-sharing service and determining the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Project Process
1. Perform exploratory analysis on data from large csv files.

2. Use Matplotlib to create and annotate line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, box-and-whisker plots and adding error bars.

3. Determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics.

### Challenge

Challenge Goal

Create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data with key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type

Summary Table Conclusion: By comparing the average fare per rides between each city type, rural cities have highest average fare per ride than suburban and urban by around four dollars and 10 dollars, respectively. For the column of average fare per driver, rural cities also perform well than suburban and urban cities by 40% and 230%. The reason is that the rides and drivers count of rural cities, significantly lower than urban and suburban cities. It leads to average values greater than urban and suburban.

Creating a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city

Multiple-Line Plot conclusion: This multiple-line charts showcases the total fare per city type changes by times. The X axis shows date from 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019, and total fare in Y axis. In that line chart, Urban cities have highest total fares all the time, and Rural cities are lowest all over time. Suburban's line is in the middle.

Furthermore, the urban's line shows there are several peaks in March and April. At the same time, the line of rural shows some correlation to Urban's line. For example in the first week of March, urban's total fares are over 2,500 dollars. In parallel to that, rural's line reaches the lowest point, less than 360 dollars.
